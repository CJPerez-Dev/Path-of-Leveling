# THIS IS WIP!

I am creating a tool to help streamline the leveling experience in Path of Exile. This tool is pre-alpha and is missing the majority of the main features. Overtime, I plan to include the following features:

- A list of every recommended step through the campaign to ensure important objectives are met
- An in-game overlay that shows a summarized version of the app while retaining the main functionality of the windowed application
- Player controlled checklists to mark completed steps through the campaign
- Recommended routes through every area of the campaign
- Automatic zone detection to show relevant objectives in each area
- Path of Building (or player specified) integration to recommend gem purchases based on progression
